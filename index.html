    <!-- Intro -->
    <div class="intro" style="margin: 0px 80px;">
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ordering pastries and fancy deserts</span> has become a trend amongst
      millennials. From quick snapshots on their snap stories to full Instagram pages dedicated for
      curating deserts: millennials are substituting desert quantity by quality. This
      opens up many new opportunities when designing new experiences. Moving forward
      with this project, we asked ourselves, “How might we improve and design a
      delivery system that provides an experience of being at a bakery or a coffee shop?”
    </br></br>
      We conducted research and found many issues that arise with the proper delivery of pastries.
      Several  key issues include keeping the right temperature while delivering the pastry (around 4°C).
      Most food delivery platforms have a limited selection of deserts, especially ones that require cool
      temperatures during serving.</p>

    <!-- Research -->

    <header>Research Process</header>
    <p>With an idea in mind, we came up with a list of things we wanted to know. Going into the research phase,
      we defined assumptions: what do we know, what we know but can’t know, what we know but can know. With this
      list, we came up with a list of questions that we sent out in Ottawa. We also set up meetings with bakeries
      to gather more information about the bakery industry and our target market.</p>

    Some of the key research findings are:
    <ul>
      <li>People on average eat deserts once or twice a week</li>
      <li>Most people eat deserts when stressed (particularly university students before exams)</li>
      <li>People mostly crave deserts immediately after a meal</li>
      <li>The majority is getting their deserts from grocery stores or local bakeries</li>
      <li>Less than 5% of the surveyed order deserts from UberEats or SkipTheDishes</li>
    </ul>

    What goals are we trying to achieve?
    <ul>
      <li>Help users order high quality deserts</li>
      <li>Allow a “round-the-clock” delivery service for our late night snackers</li>
      <li>Increase the selection range of artisanal pastries available at the hands of our users</li>
    </ul>

    How will we define and measure product success?
    <ul>
      <li>The delivered deserts are as good as when they leave the bakery</li>
      <li>The transaction within the app from the menu to the cart is effortless</li>
      <li>Recurring customers every week</li>
    </ul>

      <header>User Segmentation and User Needs</header>

      <p>
      <span>Students:</span> Low priced Pastries and Baked goods should be considered to cater to students who
      might not have the means to purchase artisanal pastries regularly. Students also tend to stress eat during
      midterm and exam seasons.

      <span>Families:</span> with higher incomes would be an ideal customer segment for artisanal pastries
      including upselling on other products.

      <span>Gatherings:</span> Gathering between friends may require the purchase of quality
      desserts

      <span>Events:</span> Many events might find it suitable to obtain pastries and baked goods for the attendees

      <span>Offices:</span> Many employees might consider satisfying their sweet tooth on the job with high quality desserts.
