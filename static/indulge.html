        <h1>The Challenge</h1>
        <p>With the rise of numerous delivery services that aim
        to achieve high volume, rather than good quality, it
        has been increasingly difficult to find places online
        that sell high quality deserts.</p>

        <h1>The Outcome</h1>

    <!-- Intro -->
    <div class="intro margin-box">
      <p><span>Ordering pastries and fancy deserts</span> has become a trend amongst
      millennials. From quick snapshots on their snap stories to full Instagram pages dedicated for
      curating deserts: millennials are substituting desert quantity by quality. This
      opens up many new opportunities when designing new experiences. Moving forward
      with this project, we asked ourselves, “How might we improve and design a
      delivery system that provides an experience of being at a bakery or a coffee shop?”
    </br></br>
      We conducted research and found many issues that arise with the proper delivery of pastries.
      Several  key issues include keeping the right temperature while delivering the pastry (around 4°C).
      Most food delivery platforms have a limited selection of deserts, especially ones that require cool
      temperatures during serving.</p>

    <!-- Research -->
    <div class="margin-box">
    <h1>Research Process</h1>
    <p>With an idea in mind, we came up with a list of things we wanted to know. Going into the research phase,
      we defined assumptions: what do we know, what we know but can’t know, what we know but can know. With this
      list, we came up with a list of questions that we sent out in Ottawa. We also set up meetings with bakeries
      to gather more information about the bakery industry and our target market.</p>
    </br>
    <h2>Some of the key research findings are:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>People on average eat deserts once or twice a week</li>
      <li>Most people eat deserts when stressed (particularly university students before exams)</li>
      <li>People mostly crave deserts immediately after a meal</li>
      <li>The majority is getting their deserts from grocery stores or local bakeries</li>
      <li>Less than 5% of the surveyed order deserts from UberEats or SkipTheDishes</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    <h2>What goals are we trying to achieve?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Help users order high quality deserts</li>
      <li>Allow a “round-the-clock” delivery service for our late night snackers</li>
      <li>Increase the selection range of artisanal pastries available at the hands of our users</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    <h2>How will we define and measure product success?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The delivered deserts are as good as when they leave the bakery</li>
      <li>The transaction within the app from the menu to the cart is effortless</li>
      <li>Recurring customers every week</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="margin-box">
      <h1>User Segmentation and User Needs</h1>

      <p>
      <strong>Students:</strong> Low priced Pastries and Baked goods should be considered to cater to students who
      might not have the means to purchase artisanal pastries regularly. Students also tend to stress eat during
      midterm and exam seasons.
      </br></br>
      <strong>Families:</strong> with higher incomes would be an ideal customer segment for artisanal pastries
      including upselling on other products.
      </br></br>
      <strong>Gatherings:</strong> Gathering between friends may require the purchase of quality
      desserts
      </br></br>
      <strong>Events:</strong> Many events might find it suitable to obtain pastries and baked goods for the attendees
      </br></br>
      <strong>Offices:</strong> Many employees might consider satisfying their sweet tooth on the job with high quality desserts.

      <p>
        We decided to create an iOS app for this project. Thus, Swift was used to make the front end of the app and Firebase for the backend.
        A simple MVC architecture has been chosen because of the architectural simplicity of the app. The storyboard was avoided since it often
        resulted in merging conflicts when working on Github, so all views are created programmatically with auto layout. Zeplin came to the
        rescue when creating programmatic constraints.
        </br></br>
        Additional libraries we used was Kingfisher for cashing images, Google Address Autocomplete API and Stripe for payment.

        We have all played a role in the project deciding key features and the overall business plan,
        as well as research. During development, I (Michel Balamou) designed and coded the app using
        insights from the research that we gathered when talking to bakeries and potential customers.
        Jad Slim took care of the backend server for the app and was the project manager. Khaled spend
        time doing research and finding potential ways to market our idea.
